<h1> A Visit to Guatemala 
<h2> April 12 2020
<p> When we were first there me and my friends decided to travel to Antigua and see some of the attracions 
there. After traveling, we were really tired, thirsty, and hungry. We decided to stop and get something to eat. 
There were tacos, and the owner decided to give us three of each taco for free since we have never
been to Guatemala before.

<h2> April 15 2020
<p> Me and my friends decided to go visit this church, which is very famous in the country. When we go there 
we were very suprised on what was all happening. The locals believed that in order for their prayers to be 
answered or to be forgiven of their sins, they had to walk on their knees all the way to the altar. It was
very fascinating and just cool over all. 

<p> While in Guatemala, we tried many different kind of foods, and this is the Top 10 list I made of the food I tried. 
Tacos con pollo (tacos with chicken) 
Chicken corn 
 Burritos
Enchiladas  
 Chips and Guac/Pico De Gallo\
Pepián
Pastel de banano (banana Cake)
Estofado con papas
Shucos
 Mixtas

<p> On our last day in Guatemala, we decided to go to this resturaunt very known for their crepes. 
They had all different type of different flavors, desserts, and even meals like hamburger. 
It was one of the best things I have ever tasted, then when we were done with dinner. We chose to 
go back to the hotel and swim in the pool late at night. 

<p> I also made a list of the things I sisn't want to forget at home, and I'm so glad I didn't! 
My phone 
My shower bag
Water bottle
Toothbrush/toothpaste
Pillow
