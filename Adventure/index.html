<p> When we were first there me and my friends decided to travel to Antigua and see some of the attracions 
there. After traveling, we were really tired, thirsty, and hungry. We decided to stop and get something to eat. 
There were tacos, and the owner decided to give us three of each taco for free since we have never
been to Guatemala before. </p>

<p> Me and my friends decided to go visit this church, which is very famous in the country. When we go there 
we were very suprised on what was all happening. The locals believed that in order for their prayers to be 
answered or to be forgiven of their sins, they had to walk on their knees all the way to the altar. It was
very fascinating and just cool over all. </p>

<p> On our last day in Guatemala, we decided to go to this resturaunt very known for their crepes. 
They had all different type of different flavors, desserts, and even meals like hamburger.
