    <h2>A Trip Down Memory Lane</h2>
    <p>The Richfield area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Menominee and Potawatomi peoples. In 1831, The Menominee 
    surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government. On May 31, 1841, a land speculator purchased 600 acres of land in 
    Richfield, becoming the first white landowner in the Richfield area and marking the beginning of early settlement. A group of German Catholics built 
    the community's first church in 1845 and dedicated it to Saint Hubertus. The Town of Richfield was organized on January 21, 1846, and by 1848 almost 
    all of the town's land was owned by Irish and German immigrant farmers and a few scattered English immigrants. 
    </p>
    <p> Not only did Richfield have fertile, well-watered, scenic land; but it was serviced by two railroads early in its history. This gave rise to 
    commercial as well as passenger traffic on its way to summer lake activities and Holy Hill. The Village of Richfield became a bustling center with two 
    hotels and a full complement of commercial establishments. In the early 20th century, camps and other recreational facilities began to spring 
    up on the shores of the numerous kettle lakes in Richfield, including YMCA Camp Minikani on Lake Amy Belle, which was founded in 1919.
    </p>
    <p>Other crossroads communities within the township borders â€“ Colgate, Plat, Hubertus, and Pleasant Hill developed as centers of activity providing 
    services on a smaller scale to the surrounding families. Farming and agriculture remained the dominant economic activity until rather recently.
    </p>
    <p>
    The town was primarily agricultural until the 1970s when suburbanization led to increased real estate development and a decline in farming. On November 6, 2007,
    voters approved the town's incorporation as the Village of Richfield by a margin of 3 to 1. The town became a village on February 13, 2008.
